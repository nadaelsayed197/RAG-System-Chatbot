# RAG Application

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application built with **Python** and **Streamlit**.
It allows users to upload documents, index them, and interact with an AI model that retrieves relevant context before generating responses.

## Features

* Upload documents (PDF, TXT, etc.).
* Build vector embeddings for efficient retrieval.
* Ask questions in natural language.
* Get context-aware answers generated by the AI model.
* Simple Streamlit web interface.
